# morphgology
Mathematical morphology - Image analysis. Digital processing of binary images.

Morphology is a project dealing with the subject of digital image processing, using morphological operations such as dilatation, erosion, opening, closing, top-hat and bottom-hat. It is a window program, written in the Qt Creator environment with the use of the OpenCV library.
The user is able to open any image in the allowed format (ie * .png, * .jpg, * .jpeg) and see the original and binary images in the program window. The processed image is obtained by selecting the morphological operation, which is enabled by the appropriate buttons.
